# House Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset used for training the model is from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques."

## Files

- `main.py`: Main script to launch the GUI for house price prediction.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Module for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- `model_training.py`: Module for training the linear regression model.
- `gui.py`: Module for creating the graphical user interface.
- `house_logo.png`: Image file of the house logo used in the GUI.
- `house_price_model.pkl`: Trained model saved as a pickle file.
- `README.txt`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `main.py` to launch the GUI.
4. Enter the square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
5. Click "Predict Price" to see the predicted house price.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tkinter
- Pillow (for image processing)

## Credits

This project was completed as part of an internship at Prodigy Infotech. Special thanks to the team for their support and guidance.
